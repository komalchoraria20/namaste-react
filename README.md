## TIME FOR THE TEST!

**1. What are different types of testing?**

1. Manual Testing
2. Automated testing
3. Unit Testing
4. Integration Testing

**2. What is Enzyme?**

Enzyme is a JavaScript testing library mainly used for React unit testing.
It's a small testing library often combined with Jest to create test cases.

**3. Enzyme vs React testing library**

Enzyme allows you to access the internal workings of your components. You can read and set the state, and you can mock children to make tests run faster.

On the other hand, react-testing-library doesn't give you any access to the implementation details. It renders the components and provides utility methods to interact with them. The idea is that you should communicate with your application in the same way a user would.

**4. What is Jest and why do we use it?**

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.
